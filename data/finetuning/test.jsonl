Tendinitis and tendon rupture have also occurred in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors. Discontinue Moxifloxacin Tablets immediately if the patient experiences pain, swelling, inflammation or rupture of a tendon. Patients should be advised to rest at the first sign of tendinitis or tendon rupture, and to contact their healthcare provider regarding changing to a non-quinolone antimicrobial drug.

In malnourished patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) nandrolone decanoate was beneficial in regaining respiratory muscle strength.74Recent data showed an improvement in expiratory and inspiratory muscle strength following treatment with oxandrolone in patients with tetraplegia.75 This increase in muscle strength was attributed to the observed increase in diaphragm muscle mass and resulted in an increased vital capacity. Basin and co-workers showed a beneficial effect of a high dose of testosterone on fat free body mass, muscle size, and peripheral muscle strength in normal men.76 During the 1970s and 1980s several studies were performed to investigate the additional effects of anabolic steroids on a training programme in healthy athletes. The results of these studies varied from no additional effect on muscle force production and no improvement in aerobic capacity77 78 to a small but significant increase in muscle force.", "focus_drug": "steroids", "source": "MedicationQA"}

Long-term domiciliary oxygen therapy (LTOT) improves survival in COPD with chronic hypoxaemia. Oral steroid medication has been associated with improved survival in men and increased mortality in women, while inhaled steroid medication has been associated with a reduction in the exacerbation rate. We have analysed the relationships between pharmacological therapy including oxygen therapy, sex, performance status and need for hospitalization and mortality in 403 patients with COPD (201 men) after their registration in a national oxygen register for LTOT. The mean value of days spent in hospital per year was 44. An increased need of hospital care was independently predicted by a poor performance status, high age and, in women, orally administered steroid medication. Hospital admissions were significantly longer in the terminal stage of COPD among women receiving oral steroid medication. Increased mortality was predicted by a poor performance status and, in women, oral steroid treatment. Predictors of morbidity and mortality during LTOT were found to coincide. The increased mortality in women receiving oral steroid medication was found to be associated with an increased need of hospital care due to longer hospital stays during the terminal stage of the disease. When analysing effects and side-effects of steroid medication in COPD, the possibility of sex-related differences should be considered.", "focus_drug": "fluticasone, oxygen", "source": "MedicationQA"}
